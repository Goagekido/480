<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>While researching for our Capstone Project on future global interstate conflict, we found a data set called “Correlates of War” (COW). With this dataset, we could try to use Machine Learning to predict which country, specifically China, Iran, and Russia, could initiate an interstate conflcit in the future. Therefore, our research problem is: “How can we use machine learning to predict whether Iran, Russia, or China may initiate future interstate conflict?”</p>
