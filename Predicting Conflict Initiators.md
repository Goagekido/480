<h2 align="center">Christian Davis & Mark Mathies</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>While researching for our Capstone Project on future global interstate conflict, we found a data set called “Correlates of War” (COW). With this dataset, we could try to use machine learning to predict whether a country, specifically China, Iran, and Russia, could initiate an interstate conflcit in the future. Therefore, our research problem is: “How can we use machine learning to predict whether Iran, Russia, or China may initiate future interstate conflict?”</p>
<h3>Description of the Data:</h3>
<p>The COW project was founded by a professor from the University of Michigan and is used for academic study. This dataset has quantitative and qualitative data on all global interstate conflict between the years 1816-2007, such as: War names, what states were involved, What side the states were on, who initiated, Where the war was fought, the outcome of the war, the year it started/ended, How many people died for each state, Military expenditure for each state (some in US dollars, some in British pounds), Military personnel, State resource production, and State demographics.</p>
